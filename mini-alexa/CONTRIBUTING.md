Add an elif condition to give custom commands to your answering machine. 

<code>
  elif 'are you single' in command:
  
        cmd = talk('I am in a relationship with WiFi')
  
        print(cmd)
  </code>
  
Download the python program and run it to enjoy talking with your customized Alexa. 
Do it with caution so that it does not break. Else the PR would be reported.
